	      <p class="">A two-day event designed to teach girls programming skills, excite them about technology, and get them creating using computers!</p>
	      <p>There are three different tracks: Scratch for beginners, App Inventor for those who want to makes Android Apps, and Python for those who want a challenge.
	        <p>Projects will be made in teams of two or three, and each group will have a mentor who knows the language and can help them out.</p> 
	        <p>At the end of two days everyone will have made something to be proud of, and will have learned the basics of how to program.</p>

	      <h2>Think about what you want to build</h2>

			<p class="">One of the most difficult things about hackathons is working out what you want to make! We'll do our best to inspire you on the day, but if you come with some sort of idea, it's one less thing to worry about.

				<p>One bit of advice: Start SMALL!</p>
	      	<p>Modern games take quite a long time to build. Try not to dream up big, complicated, thousand-level quests, because you probably won't get it finished! The best games will be ones that are based on a simple idea. You'll be able to build up the complexity during the day, but start off small!
	        
	        Think of simple games you've played in the past, like <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user4-HKXlT7QJmX743a5.py">Pong</a> or <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user17_NQ8IvSwpjR_1.py">Memory</a>, and add your own twist, or come up with something new altogether!</p>
	      
	 	    <p>Anything 3D or online multiplayer sadly won't be possible on the day, unless you already know how to do it (in which case, please teach us!)</p>
	      
			 	 <h2>Learning</h2>

	          <p>
	            The morning of the first day will be taken up with tutorials and learning the languages. However, there’s a lot to learn, so everyone who does a some in advance will have a big advantage, and will be able to work on more advanced things in this time.
	          </p>
	      
	     	 <h3 id="scratch"><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></h3>
	      <p>Scratch is a great first programming language. It's very visual - a bit like clicking together building blocks. Recommended for complete beginners - you'll be making your first computer games in no time!</p>
	      
	      <ul>
	        <li>Have a look around the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch site</a></li>
	        <li><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted">Make your first project and learn the basics</a></li>
	        <li>Look at some <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/featured/">examples</a> that other people have made, like <a href=http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/463279/>Hangman</a> or a <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11697091/">Piano</a></li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <h3><a id="appinventor"href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor</a></h3>
	      <p>App Inventor is very similar to Scratch, only it lets you create apps for phones instead. Android is currently the only system supported, but they aim to add more in the future.</p>
	      
	      <ul>
	        <li>Have a look around the <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/">App Inventor site</a></li>
	        <li>Do some <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/tutorials.html">tutorials </a> (we particularly recommend the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/teach/magic-8-ball.html">Magic 8-ball</a> and <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/molemash.html">Mole Mash</a>)</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h3 id="python"><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a></h3>
	      <p>We’ll be doing a lot of python basics, which are very well covered by the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">Codecademy Python course</a>. You guys who’ve picked Python will have to learn a lot very quickly, so I’d strongly encourage you to at least do a few lessons to familiarise yourself!</p>

	      <h3>Laptops</h3>
	      <p>O2 have very kindly loaned us a laptop for every participant! This means that you don't need to bring your own computer. However, if you want to work on your own machine, you're more than welcome to. Please make yourself known to a helper on the day, so we can check over your equipment</p>
	      <h3>Phones</h3> One of our tracks is App Inventor, which allows you to make Android apps. If you have an Android phone, please bring it along, so you can try out the creations!
